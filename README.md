# Simulating Multiple Paternity in Black Soldier Flies

RB Smith's 2023 Summer MSc Project

This code creates a simulation that models experiments for detecting multiple paternity in Black Soldier Fly clutches. The scripts `MP_DetectionPower.R` and `PoolSequencing_MPDetection.R` are complete, with explanations and instructions on using them in the scripts' comments. The former simulates an individual sequencing method, while the latter simulates a pool sequencing method. The rest are incomplete scripts that I committed to the repo while building the simulation.
